# NeoClock
A WiFi connected LED clock, made from 256 RGB LEDs and a Raspberry Pi

# Parts
Wow! Sorry folks it appears since AdaFruit also did a flexible panel just like these ones the price has SKY ROCKETED,
the cheapest I could find was https://www.aliexpress.com/item/8-32-Digital-RGB-LED-Matrix-is-consist-of-WS2812B-RGB-LED-addressable-Individually-Pixel/32350495942.html

# Build
The Data Pin for the matrix is defined in NeoClock.py at the top of the file, see the comments for more details - connec the *Data* *In* pin from the NeoPixels to this pin number. 

# Future
## Software

## Hardware
 * I will continue with this NeoClock
 * I shall be researching a cheaper display to make the project more affordable for others again...
